#Landed Title Migrations
#Handles landed_title changes from one version to new, which typically happens if map expansions were involved (the RoI patch is an example). If the converter encounters a title not available in the CK2 install, it will check this file and attempt to use the new title as a replacement 

# link = { old =  new =  }

link = { old = b_lori new = b_lori_berd }
link = { old = k_seljuk_turks new = e_seljuk_turks }

}
